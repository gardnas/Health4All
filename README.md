# Health4All Project Continutation

**INFO Winter 2026 / Spring 2026 Capstone Project:**
*Team Chansey*

## Project Description
**Health4All** is a website that provides geographic breast cancer data and social determinants of health (SDOH) statistics in an accessible and understandable way for general audiences seeking to explore their correlation in order to be more informed about screening and other preventative interventions.

## Current Features
In its current state, the website has four pages:
* **Home Page:** Introduces the the project.
* **Map Page:** Hosts the interactive GIS tool that visualizes breast cancer incidence across King County.
    * *Includes:* Interactive map with color-coded regions, tooltips, and detailed statistics by area.
* **Resource Page:** Connects users with real-world support services across multiple categories.
* **About Page:** Provides transparency regarding the original data sources and mission.

## Planned Features
Currently, we are working on the following list of features: 

* New starting page / landing page with context for users unfamiliar in this domain to get started and be able to understand the website and its information. This would include a reminder that breast cancer rates does not equal the risk for transparency and safety of our users.
* Users can hover over health jargon for its definition to help break down health related knowledge barriers.
* Loading screen for data visualizations.
* Adding search functionality for specific zip codes and neighborhoods.
* Summary of how a regions rates / stats relate to SDOH stats.
* Sources page to be more transparent about where the data is coming from as well as limitations.
* Additional visualizations to showcase key points and takeaways in more digestible ways.
* Including baseline stats such as averages or comparisons to other places for a better gauge on a statistic.
* Providing a FAQ on how to use the website, who it's for, what steps to take, and the "why" behind the project.
* Mobile optimization to ensure mobile users can access and navigate the website.
